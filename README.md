Raksha Pipes Database and Dashboard

This project showcases the integration of Python, SQL, and Power BI for efficient data analysis
and visualization. It demonstrates how these tools can be used together to manipulate, query, and
visualize data from various sources.

Project Description:

Step 1: Fake Data Generation(Python)

Purpose: Generate synthetic data using Python libraries like faker to simulate customer, order, and
supplier information.

Method:

 Utilize Python scripts to generate realistic-looking data.

 Use libraries such as faker to create data for customers, orders, orderdetails, products,
shippers, payments, categories, and suppliers.

Step 2: Database Creation(SQL)

Purpose: Store the generated fake data in a SQL database for structured storage and querying.

Method:

 Execute the Raksha_Database.sql script to create the database schema.

 Import the synthetic data into the MySQL Workbench.

Step 2: Power BI Dashboard

Purpose: Create interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize the data stored in the
SQL database

Method:

 Connect Power BI to the SQL database

 Import necessary tables into Power BI for analysis.

 Design visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line charts, KPI cards) to analyze key metrics and
trends.

 Arrange visualizations on the dashboard canvas to provide actionable insights to
stakeholders.

The Raksha Pipes Project demonstrates end-to-end data processing, from synthetic data generation
using Python to database creation and visualization in Power BI. It highlights the seamless
integration of these technologies to enable data-driven decision-making and insights for
stakeholders.
